# WeLoveDevs - Developer Profile

This package allow you to create a pretty and easy to use - _developer specific_ - profile without the usual strain that comes with it.
You can use, edit and do whatever you desire with it.

**However**, we understand not everyone have the time nor wants to deal with all this, this is why we decided to create a free SAAS version here.

We are open for feedbacks and will answers your issues as soon as we can.

# Usage

You can integrate this profile as such:

```
import { DeveloperProfile } from '@welovedevs/developer-profile';

const ApplicationComponent = () => {
    return (
        <DeveloperProfile
            options={...}
            theme={...}
        />
    );
}

export const Application = ApplicationComponent;
``` 

## Theming

We created a default theme based on WeLoveDevs' graphical identity.

You can modify this theme and create your own unique style.

Please see `utils/styles/theme/theme.js` for an example.


# Pull Requests & Coding Guideline

You can fork and edit this package as you desire.

If you want to create pull requests (ðŸ’™) then following some rules will be highly appreciated:

## Props spreading

Even though we - at WeLoveDevs - really like spreading as much as we can, we decided to **NOT** spread components props as it can leads to quite a lot of side effects.

Example:

Do **not** write

`<Component {...{ key, data } />`

Do write

`<Component key={key} data={data} />`



## Architecture

We use a project structure which, we believe, is the most readable.
